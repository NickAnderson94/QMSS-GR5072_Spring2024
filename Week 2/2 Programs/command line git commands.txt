# Add file to staging area - before commit. git does not track files by default
git add path/filename

# Add all files to staging area --- Note: This is not generally recommended. Use caution
git add .

# Compare files in staging area -- HEAD stands for most recent commit, -r means compare versions
git diff -r HEAD

# Compare particular file
git diff -r HEAD path/to/file

# Undo unstaged changes to file -- Note: Changes are permanent, so use carefully!
git checkout -- path/filename

# Remove all files in a directory from staging (leaving off path resets all files in all directories which have been staged)
git reset HEAD path

# Undo changes to a file which is already staged
git reset HEAD path/to/file
git checkout -- path/to/file

# Unstage and restore previous versions for all files
git reset
git checkout -- .

# Restore previous version of a file which was saved as a commit. Note: When you restore a previous version, you have to commit it again
